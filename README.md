# image-processing
a simple code with matlab that find what u want from main picture with ur specific picture,


example:
we want to find an IC in a circuit 


so at first we  select main pic

![main pic](https://github.com/A-weirdo/image-processing/blob/main/Printed-Circuit-Board.jpg)


and then IC what we want to find :

after selecting those two pic , code bring them to the gray mode and find them with  Brightness , it makes the proccing save time and use less energi and also it takes less time in coding , and then it start to find similar with 2d correlation coefficient.

and then print the result.
